**Introduction**
-----
In the context of large language models (LLMs), current advanced reasoning methods have made impressive strides in various reasoning tasks. However, when it comes to logical reasoning tasks, significant challenges remain in both efficacy and efficiency. This is rooted in the fact that these systems fail to fully leverage the inherent structure of logical tasks throughout the reasoning processes, including decomposition, search, and resolution. To address this, this paper proposes a logic-complete reasoning framework, Aristotle. The framework consists of three key components: Logical Decomposer, Logical Search Router, and Logical Resolver, in which symbolic expressions and logical rules are comprehensively integrated into the entire reasoning process, significantly alleviating the bottlenecks of logical reasoning, i.e., reducing sub-task complexity, minimizing search errors, and resolving logical contradictions. Experimental results demonstrate that Aristotle consistently outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning frameworks in both accuracy and efficiency, particularly excelling in complex logical reasoning scenarios.

**Setup**
------
Please install all the required packages first by running the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Translation and Decomposition**
-----
To use Aristotle for logical inference, we first need to prepare the data by translating and decomposing it, as illustrated in Step 1 of the figure.

Please run the following command to do that:
```
python translate_decompose.py \
    --api_key "Your API Key" \
    --model_name "Model Name [gpt-4 | gpt-4o]" \
    --data_path "./data" \
    --dataset_name "Dataset [ProntoQA | ProofWriter | LogicNLI]" \
    --split dev \
    --max_new_tokens 6144 \
    --batch_num "Number of batches to execute in parallel"
```
The results will be saved in the ```./results```.

**Initialization**
-----
We need to initialize two search paths for the reasoning task before starting the search. Run the command below to perform the initialization:
```
python negate.py \
    --dataset_name "Dataset [ProntoQA | ProofWriter | LogicNLI]" \
    --model "Model Name [gpt-4 | gpt-4o]"
```
After successful initialization, a JSON file with the suffix "negated_data" will be generated in the ```./results```.

**Search and Resolve**
-----
At this stage, as shown in **Step 2** of the figure, we perform **search and resolve** on two reasoning paths (corresponding to two JSON files): one with the suffix `"no_negation"` and the other with `"negated_data"`.

To complete this step, run the command below **twice**, setting `--negation` to `True` for one run and `False` for the other.
```
python search_resolve.py \
    --api_key "Your API Key" \
    --model_name "Model Name [gpt-4 | gpt-4o]" \
    --data_path "./data" \
    --dataset_name "Dataset [ProntoQA | ProofWriter | LogicNLI]" \
    --split dev \
    --negation "Run on negated data [True | False]" \
    --max_new_tokens 4096 \
    --batch_num "Number of batches to execute in parallel"
```
After sucessfully finishing the search and resolve, two result files will be generated in the ```./results```, corresponding to two search path with suffix `"search_negation_True"` and `"search_negation_False"`.

**Conclusion and Evaluation**
-----
We now have the results of two search path, so we can conclude the final answer by aggregating the result of two path using the formular (1) as shown in the paper.
Please run the below command to conclude and evaluate the answer.
```
python evaluate.py \
    --dataset_name "Dataset [ProntoQA | ProofWriter | LogicNLI]" \
    --model "Model Name [gpt-4 | gpt-4o]"
```

**CUSTOM RUN**

Runpod Specific Run on Jupyter Notebook:
Dont use A100 PCIe, Kernel keeps restarting when loading HFbackend on SahabatAI-llama3-8b-v1-instruct
4-bit quantization makes batch_size >1 error, while non 4-bit quantization makes it OOM GPU on some cases (Tested on A100 80GB SXM)

Connect with SSH or Web terminal on the machine
Check os version: cat /etc/os-release
Update first:
apt update
apt install git-lfs

os.environ["MKL_NUM_THREADS"] = "1"

snapshot_path = "/workspace/LLM_MODELS/Llama-SEA-LION-v3.5-8B-R" ############## <--- Change this based on platform and models

os.environ["LOCAL_MODEL_PATH"] = snapshot_path
######### set LLM_MODEL to the same path so OpenAIModel or translate script picks it up if it uses LLM_MODEL env
os.environ["LLM_MODEL"] = snapshot_path

######## enable 4-bit for quant (and bitsandbytes is set up)
os.environ["LLM_LOAD_IN_4BIT"] = "1"  # or "0" to disable quantization

print("LOCAL_MODEL_PATH =", os.environ["LOCAL_MODEL_PATH"])
print("LLM_MODEL =", os.environ["LLM_MODEL"])


######### Quick test generation using existing HFBackend

from llm_backends import HFBackend
import os, traceback

local_path = os.environ.get("LOCAL_MODEL_PATH")
print("Using local_path:", local_path)

try:
    ######### create backend that points to the local model path (this uses the existing class)
    backend = HFBackend(local_model_path=local_path, hf_model_id=None, quantize_4bit=(os.environ.get("LLM_LOAD_IN_4BIT","0")=="1"))
    print("HFBackend initialized OK")
    print("Tokenizer pad_token_id:", getattr(backend.tokenizer, "pad_token_id", None))
    print("Model device:", getattr(backend, "device", None))
    ######### test small generation
    prompt = "Translate to formal logic: If it rains, the ground will be wet."
    out = backend.generate(prompt, max_new_tokens=200, temperature=0.0, top_p=1.0, do_sample=False)

print("\nFisnished translating dataset\n")


!python translate_prompts.py --file ./prompts/ProntoQA/and_or_decomposer.txt --overwrite
print("\nFisnished translating prompts\n")

Then download the translated dataset and prompts
Delete the pod after, disk usage is EXPENSIVE

***TRANSLATION_DECOMPOSE DATASET***
!pip install transformers safetensors sentencepiece huggingface-hub accelerate bitsandbytes tqdm openai backoff retrying protobuf


!git lfs install
!git clone https://huggingface.co/Sahabat-AI/llama3-8b-cpt-sahabatai-v1-instruct LLM_MODELS/llama3-8b-cpt-sahabatai-v1-instruct

***SCORING***
We can check for other LLM performance, especially on instruction following ini this case on Indonesia dataset in: https://leaderboard.sea-lion.ai/
Qwen3-8b seems good for general purpose LLM

***TRANSLATION***
Komodo on paper is good for translation, but there's no instruct version, even then It compared to Llama2, gpt3.5, Qwen1.5
NusaMT is built on Komodo-base and on paper excel on Bali and Minang
Based on leaderboard above, use SEALIONv3-8b
Tried to use SahabatAIv1-8b, it took 50 mins, while SEALION took 15 mins to translate 10% of ProntoQA dataset
